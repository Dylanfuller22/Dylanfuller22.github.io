    <dd>I have always had a passion for cooking and food. Food allows me to express a creative side of me that I dont get to express anywhere else. Whether it's coming up with new recipes or trying a new restaurant, food has afforded me opportunities to expand my boundaries. Food is also reflected throughout my family. We pride ourselves on our cooking and our old family recipes, passed down on index cards and scraps of paper over multiple generations. I continue to try and expand my palette and step out of my comfort zone. Some of my favorite cuisines include Italian, Mexican, and Greek food.</dd>
