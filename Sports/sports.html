    <dd>Ever since I was a kid, I always had a love for sports. Growing up as an athlete, I was very versatile, playing soccer, basketball, and baseball. Now, I have found a new passion for analyzing sports. Being a student in Wisconsin, I have fallen in love with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Green Bay Packers. These teams have had success in recent years and I look forward to conituing to follow the teams and the statistics of each player.</dd>
